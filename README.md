The release page contains the installer file. You must download that file and execute it to install the application.

Installation notes
------------------
- The installer targets common desktop environments.
- Select the correct package for your operating system.
- If you use an external GPU, enable hardware encoders in settings for faster exports.

Getting started
---------------
- Create a new project and set your timeline resolution.
- Import media using drag-and-drop or the Media panel.
- Use the AI tools to detect scenes or auto-generate a rough cut.
- Fine-tune clips with keyframes and the curves editor.
- Apply color grade and master audio using the mixer.
- Export using a preset or custom settings for codec, bitrate, and container.

Common workflows
----------------
- Social short: 1080p60 with H.264, target 8–12 Mbps.
- YouTube longform: 4K H.265 with target bitrate around 40–80 Mbps.
- Archive: ProRes or DNxHR for masters.

Command-line and automation
---------------------------
The build includes basic CLI helpers to automate batch exports and render queues. See /scripts for examples. Use them to integrate renders into CI or studio pipelines.

Sample CLI pattern:
- scripts/render.sh --project "ProjectName" --preset "YouTube-4K"

Effects and presets
-------------------
The premium pack adds:
- Film grain and organic texture overlays.
- Advanced transitions with physics-based motion.
- LUTs and film emulations tuned for different cameras.
- Dynamic text templates with motion presets.

Tips for best results
--------------------
- Edit at your target resolution when working with heavy effects.
- Use proxies if you work with very high bitrates.
- Lock color grade before final render to avoid re-rendering the whole timeline.
- Render audio stem exports separately to keep final mixes flexible.

Performance tuning
------------------
- Enable hardware acceleration if your GPU supports it.
- Close background apps that use CPU and disk I/O during long renders.
- Use SSDs for media whenever possible.
